# Project Scope: AI Meeting Transcriber Optimization

## Current State Analysis

### What This Project Is
A real-time meeting transcription tool that:
- Captures audio from microphone/system audio
- Transcribes speech using OpenAI Whisper API
- Analyzes content with GPT-4 for insights
- Provides live updates via WebSocket
- Works with any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc.)

### Core Functionality (DO NOT CHANGE)
1. **Audio Capture**: PyAudio-based microphone recording
2. **Voice Detection**: WebRTC VAD for speech detection
3. **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper API integration
4. **Analysis**: GPT-4 for extracting important points, questions, and action items
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket communication
6. **Export**: HTML report generation

## Optimization Scope

### 1. Performance Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- Processes every 10-second chunk regardless of content
- No caching mechanism for API responses
- Sequential API calls instead of parallel processing
- Memory accumulation over long sessions

**Proposed Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement smart buffering - only process when speech confidence > threshold
- [ ] Add response caching to avoid re-analyzing similar content
- [ ] Parallelize Whisper and GPT-4 API calls where possible
- [ ] Implement memory cleanup for sessions > 1 hour
- [ ] Add connection pooling for API requests

### 2. Cost Reduction
**Current Issues:**
- Sends all audio chunks to Whisper API ($0.006/minute)
- Analyzes every transcript with GPT-4 (expensive)
- No rate limiting or budget controls

**Proposed Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement local VAD pre-filtering (already started, needs refinement)
- [ ] Batch multiple small transcripts before GPT-4 analysis
- [ ] Add configurable analysis frequency (e.g., every 30s instead of 10s)
- [ ] Implement daily/monthly budget limits
- [ ] Add usage tracking and cost estimation display

### 3. Reliability Improvements
**Current Issues:**
- No retry mechanism for failed API calls
- WebSocket disconnections not handled gracefully
- No automatic session recovery
- Silent failures in audio capture

**Proposed Optimizations:**
- [ ] Add exponential backoff retry for API calls
- [ ] Implement WebSocket reconnection logic
- [ ] Add session persistence and recovery
- [ ] Improve error handling with user notifications
- [ ] Add health check endpoint with detailed status

### 4. Code Quality & Efficiency
**Current Issues:**
- Deprecated datetime.utcnow() usage
- Mixed async/sync patterns
- No type hints
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Large monolithic app.py file (600+ lines)

**Proposed Optimizations:**
- [ ] Fix deprecation warnings
- [ ] Consistent async implementation
- [ ] Add type hints throughout
- [ ] Move configurations to structured settings
- [ ] Modularize code into logical components:
  - `audio_capture.py` - Audio handling
  - `transcription.py` - Whisper integration
  - `analysis.py` - GPT-4 integration
  - `websocket_handler.py` - WebSocket management
  - `config.py` - Configuration management

### 5. Resource Optimization
**Current Issues:**
- No audio compression before API calls
- Full transcript history kept in memory
- No cleanup of old session files
- Browser keeps all updates in DOM

**Proposed Optimizations:**
- [ ] Compress audio to reduce bandwidth (WAV â†’ compressed format)
- [ ] Implement sliding window for transcript history
- [ ] Auto-cleanup sessions older than 7 days
- [ ] Virtualize frontend transcript display
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for historical data
